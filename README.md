SimpleBot
=========

A Steam trade bot written from scratch.
The idea with this program was to create a more simple, lightweight version of Jessecar's SteamBot, while implementing more features.
Almost every automatic trading bot I have seen is very slow, and runs off of SteamBot. I am here to change that

Setup
=====

Compile, and run SteamBot.exe. You will be asked for a backpack.tf API key, a Steam API key, and a Steam login. Then, enjoy your new Steam Bot!
